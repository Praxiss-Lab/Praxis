    A matched automation whose trigger sets `destination` to
    `continue_conversation` first tries to deliver the event as another turn on
    its subject's conversation, creating no run. A subject whose run is still
    queued has the turn folded into that run instead, so a burst cannot leave
    one subject with two runs. Anything else -- no subject, no run holding it,
    one whose sandbox has gone -- falls back to creating a run.

    `request` and `session_factory` are both telemetry plumbing. Telemetry
    resolves its distinct id from the database, and HTTP callers supply that
    reader indirectly as `request.app.state.session_factory`; a caller that
    passes neither drops every event silently. So non-HTTP transports must pass
    `session_factory`. It is deliberately not `session`: telemetry writes its id
    row, and sharing this session would move that write into the caller's
