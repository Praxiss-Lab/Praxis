"""Add event_id_header to custom_webhooks.

Optional HTTP header naming the provider's own delivery id, used to drop
redelivered events. Nullable with no server default: existing rows keep the
current behavior (recorded and routed, never deduplicated), and a source opts
in through the normal create/update API.
